    "In this assignment, you will use probabilistic inference and particle filtering to guide Pacman through a tracking  problem. Note: We will use the Pacman framework developed at Berkeley. This framework is used worldwide to teach AI, therefore it is very important that you DO NOT publish your solutions online."

    "### Question 1: Probability (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "a) (2 point) An _exit poll_ is a survey taken of voters just after they have voted. One major use of exit polls has been so that news organizations can try to figure out as soon as possible who won the election, before the votes are actually counted. This has been notoriously inaccurate in various elections, sometimes because of _selection bias_: the sample of people who are invited to and agree to participate in the survey may not be similar enough to the overall population of voters. Suppose there is an election with two candidates, X and Y. Every voter is presented with the option to participate in an exit poll; some participate and some refuse. For a randomly selected voter, let $X$ be the event that they voted for Candidate X, and $W$ be the event that they participate in the exit poll. Suppose that $P(W | X) = 0.8$ but $P(W | X^C) = 0.3$. In the exit poll, 65% of the respondents say that they voted for X; assuming that they are all honest, this suggests a comfortable victory for X. Find $P(X)$, the true proportion of people who voted for X. How does this compare to the 65% proportion found in the exit poll?\n",

    "b) (1 point) According to the CDC, men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer than men who don't smoke. Also according to the CDC, 21.6% of men in the U.S. smoke. What is the probability that a man in the U.S. is a smoker, given that he develops lung cancer?"

    "Ankit and Aidi decide to play a coin game to show how we can use HMMs for sequence analysis problems. Aidi tosses first, then they take turns. The game finishes when \"HTH\" appears, and whoever last flips the coin wins. At each timestep, they can flip the coin many times, and the rules for stopping and switching to the other partner are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every time Aidi flips the coin, she also flips an extra unfair coin (P(H) = 0.3). She stops if the extra unfair coin lands heads. Otherwise, she keeps flipping the fair and extra biased coin (at the same time). The flips of the extra coin are not recorded.\n",
